    <h2>About the Penguin</h2>
    <p>
      Penguins are flightless seabirds found mainly in the Southern Hemisphere. 
      They are excellent swimmers, using their wings like flippers to “fly” through the water.
      Most species live in cold regions, though some live in temperate zones.
    </p>
    <p>
      They feed on fish, krill, and squid, and are highly social animals that gather in large colonies.
      Emperor penguins can dive over 500 meters deep and hold their breath for more than 20 minutes.
