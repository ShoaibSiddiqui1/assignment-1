        <h2>About the Lion</h2>
        <p>
          Lions are large carnivorous cats native to Africa and a small population in India.
          They are social, living in groups called prides, and are known for their loud roars
          and distinctive manes (in males). Lions typically inhabit grasslands and open
          woodlands where prey such as zebra and antelope are common.

        <p>
          Females usually hunt cooperatively, while males defend the pride‚Äôs territory.
          Although often called ‚Äúking of the jungle,‚Äù lions actually prefer open habitats.
          Conservation concerns include habitat loss and conflict with humans; several
          populations are considered vulnerable.
