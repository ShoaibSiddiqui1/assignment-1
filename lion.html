    <h2>About the Lion</h2>
    <p>
      Lions are large carnivorous cats native to Africa and a small population in India.
      They are social, living in groups called prides, and are known for their loud roars
      and distinctive manes (in males). Lions typically inhabit grasslands and open
      woodlands where prey such as zebra and antelope are common.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lions (<em>Panthera leo</em>) are the only truly social big cats. Lionesses usually
      hunt cooperatively while males defend territory. Conservation concerns include
      habitat loss and conflict with humans; several populations are considered vulnerable.
